# investigations-projects
A collection of small projects by the Guardian Digital Investigations team suitable to be open sourced.

A lot of the work we do on the digital investigations team at the Guardian is story specific and so is harder to open source the code.
This repo (initially very sparse!) has been created to make it easier to store projects which potentially have value outside of the Guardian
to be shared easily, without creating a whole repo for some tiny project. The team's existing 'dumping ground' repos are all private, which goes against the Guardian's commitment to developing in the open - hopefully this is the first step in sharing more of our work.
