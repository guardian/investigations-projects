Mimetype Detector
=================

A simple scala project making use of the Apache Tika library to analyse a directory for what
types of file it contains.

Usage:

    `sbt "run /home/ubuntu/interesting_files"`

Or if you want to avoid restarting sbt all the time:

    `sbt`

Then in the sbt console:

    `run <DIRECTORY>`
